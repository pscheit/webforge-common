# webforge-common

Boilerplate for Webforge and Psc - CMS  
This small library should cover all common code between webforge and Psc - CMS, to have a small set from classes that are sufficient to start off a litte project.

## todo

- Put a lot of DateTime / Date / Time testdata into webforge-testdata and refactor the DateTime libs to 100% code-coverage
- Find a better solution for the Common\Util debugging tool (like Doctrines dump, but in nicer)
